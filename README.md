 <h2>Project:"End-to-End CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub Webhooks on AWS" </h2>

<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>In this dynamic project, I spearheaded the development and implementation of a cutting-edge Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using a powerful stack of Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, and GitHub Webhooksâ€”all orchestrated on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.</p>


<h2>Key Contributions:</h2>
<h3>Jenkins Automation:</h3>
 <p> Engineered a robust automation server setup with Jenkins, streamlining build, test, and deployment processes for increased efficiency in software delivery.</p>

<h3>Ansible Integration: </h3>
<p>Employed Ansible as a configuration management tool to ensure the consistency and reliability of application deployments across the entire infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Docker Containerization:</h3>
<p>Embraced Docker to containerize applications, enhancing portability and scalability while simplifying the management of dependencies.</p>

<h3>GitHub Webhooks Integration:</h3> 
<p>Implemented automated triggers through GitHub Webhooks, enabling seamless CI/CD pipeline execution upon code commits and minimizing manual intervention.</p>


<h3>AWS Cloud Deployment: </h3>
<p>Hosted the entire project on AWS, harnessing the scalability and availability features of cloud computing to ensure the CI/CD pipeline's adaptability to projects of varying complexities.</p>
